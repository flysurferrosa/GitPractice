Fixing the conflict

<<<<<<< HEAD
Ok - here's the "master" version, finally I'm starting to get this a little I think - right now I'm making changes that should be conflicting with the "big" branch changes I just made.  
=======
Now I'm making some more changes on this one and calling them "baseball"


ok let's see if I can figure this out...now I'm on the BIG branch, making changes.  going to save and CLOSE!
>>>>>>> big


ok so the other one was small change but now I'm back on the master before I made the small change.  I'm saving this which should be a conflict with small.
